>Important note for the Best Actor & Best Actress categories: as a rule, other categories only entertain student filmmakers for the award. However, our acting categories accommodate actors in a student film of any age. This is because we believe that a portion of the actor's performance is due to the student directors' guidance, and that is the vehicle that we're judging through.
