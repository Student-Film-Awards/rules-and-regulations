# Eligibility for Cast & Crew
If a film is selected for participation in the Student Film Awards, it is always in the form of a film being shortlisted/nominated for an awards category. Most student films are collaborative endeavors, which means there may be different people responsible for different creative aspects of a final product.

The goal of this section is to make it clear that the designated recipients of a Student Film Award are the key creative individuals responsible for the achievement.

There are always a maximum of three individuals that are allowed to be named as a recipient of a Student Film Award or a nomination/shortlist.

We determine the recipients of each award by examining the list of cast & crew submitted to us with the initial submission. Changes to this after awards are announced (whether or not it's before embargo) are voted on by the advisory committee and must be submitted in writing.
