# Welcome to the SFA Rules & Eligibility Requirements
The Student Film Awards are a film festival & awards show dedicated to celebrating the best of student film & cinema. We do so by selecting films to be nominated & shortlisted based on merit; and to select successfully on merit, we must treat each submission the same.

The rules & eligibility requirements found in this repository are the governing authority on films that are submitted for consideration for a Student Film Award. We use Github to maintain our rules & eligibility requirements so it is transparent to see how our rules have changed over time.

**To navigate these rules**, click [here](https://github.com/Student-Film-Awards/rules-and-regulations) and you'll be able to click through the different .md (text) files that make up our rules. If you require clarification, please email us at help@studentfilmawards.org. Please note, Festival staff - and in particular, our Festival co-directors, have final say over eligibility (without involving our advisory board).

We appreciate your interest in seeing whether or not your film is eligible to receive a Student Film Award.
