# The Categories of Films
The Student Film Awards has three main types of participation, all via the selection & submission process when we solicit student films. The three types of participation are shortlisted films, nominated films, and winning films.

* **Winning Films** are films selected for a SFA Festival that have won a Student Film Award. There is one winner per awards category, and a winner is always awarded at each event. Films may win in multiple categories.
* **Nominated Films** are films selected for a SFA Festival that are eligible to win a Student Film Award. It is from this group of films that a winner is chosen per award category.
* **Shortlisted Films** are films selected for a SFA Festival that are still screened, and given all other privileges of being selected to the Student Film Awards, but are not eligible to win that category's award.

The reason we select shortlisted films is for diversity (so we're able to screen more submissions), but also as a backup. If, for whatever reason, we're unable to screen a nominated film (there are copyright issues or a filmmaker pulls out), a shortlisted film replaces that slot and becomes a nominated film. If this happens, the Festival Advisory Board votes on which shortlisted film will fill the gap, and we do not select another shortlisted film to make up for it.

Usually, there are ten submissions per category. Five nominees (of which one becomes the winner) and five shortlisted films. This is only untrue in the Best Actor & Best Actress categories, where we do not solicit shortlisted films. Those categories are screened with only five nominated films, one of which wins the award category.
