# Eligibility for Director
To keep the process as fair as possible for all incoming submissions, we have a very strict eligibility policy. We're unable to grant exceptions to this policy, unfortunately; if you're seeking one, it may be worth your time to look at other festivals!

There are two levels of eligibility for a prospective submission. The first is the eligibility of the director, which determines whether or not a film is eligible to be considered for a Student Film Award. The second is the eligibility of the cast & crew; seeing, if a film is nominated or wins a Student Film Award, who can claim it as a part of their resume and experience. Section 005 will be about the eligibility for cast & crew; this section is about the director's eligibility.

### Student Status
To be considered for a Student Film Award, the director(s) associated with a submission must have been enrolled in an accredited academic institution as of the 'completion date' on their film. It is OK if you are no longer a student; as long as the film was completed while they still were a student.

We consider filmmakers enrolled in high school, college, and graduate to be students. We do not judge each category separately; this is just for eligibility criteria. Students in middle school & elementary school are welcome to apply, but we would advise you to see how competitive our program is and perhaps refocus your efforts.

We welcome homeschooled filmmakers, as well as students that have started their student filmmaking journey later in life (veterans are the most common case here). If you can proof association with academic work, we will take this into account when determining eligibility. We verify academic affiliation for all selected filmmakers before publicly announcing our slate.

### Submission Date
To be considered for a Student Film Award, the completion date of a film has to be after 12:00:00am EST on January 1st, 2020. If you did not get selected to participate in our Festival in one of our [categories](https://github.com/Student-Film-Awards/rules-and-regulations/blob/main/002%20-%20The%20Categories%20of%20Films.md), you may resubmit a film for consideration so long as the date of completion is after the cut-off date we've set for the season. 

### Incomplete & Missing Submissions
To be considered for a Student Film Award, our programming committee must be able to access your completed film at the time you submit it. Incomplete submissions are immediately disqualified and won't be considered again for the submission season, even if the complete film is later uploaded. If we encounter a file that we cannot open (password protected, private video, etc.) we will make reasonable attempt to contact the filmmaker before disqualifying.

### Brunt of Work
To be considered for a Student Film Award, you must be able to demonstrate that students completed the brunt of the work on an eligible film. It is perfectly alright to solicit the help and advice of professionals, even if those professionals are paid, but there is a reasonable distinction between a professional helping out 'here and there', versus a film professional that has been hired to do the work while a student filmmaker places their name on the finished product.
